I have managed to create a form in which sends the information you input into superbase, I have styled the form to make it center and easy to send off. I have created the API and managed to connect the client and the server to work as a tream, I managed to create a table using superbase and store the messages that are sent to it, I have managed to fetch them to create them on the backpage. I was not able to achieve displaying it on the page as I found it difficult to work out how to do it and sort it. I found trying to get superbase and my code connected to be able to store it properly. 

I feel that I styled my html and css well, and did a good job with working out the javascript and the terminal. I used google and my tutors to help me when I got stuck. I just had a few issues with forgetting how to word things or adding things here and there.
